| Bayes Classifier using GMM using FDA |

Author: Aayush Mishra

This repository consists of programs to build Bayes Classifiers using Gaussian Mixture Model on reduced-dimensional representations obtained using linear Fisher Discriminant Analysis.
It was built as Assignment-4 of CS-669 Pattern Recognition course at IIT Mandi, Fall 2017.

The programs are contained in the directory src/py

To run the programs, use python2. (example command - "python fda.py")

The input directory is ../data/Input
You can put more data in the prescribed format and run the programs for it.

The output directory is data/Output
It will contain all reduced dimensional representations, files related to training models, and test results for future reference.

As the data can be huge to process, the programs may run for long times.
Also, the programs have been tested for a lot of times, but errors may still be present. Feedbacks will be appreciated.
